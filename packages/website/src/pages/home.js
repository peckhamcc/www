          <p>There are rides every Saturday and sometimes Sundays too.</p>
          <p>The Saturday Social Spin is an ideal introduction to the club - it's 60-80kms at a beginner friendly speed, leaving Peckham Library at 8am in the summer and 8:30am in the winter.</p>
          <p>Other rides are organised on an ad-hoc basis and the speed/distance depends on who's riding and what they are training for.</p>
          <p>Full details are posted on Facebook and Twitter towards the end of the week when we know what the weather is going to do, please check those pages for more information.</p>

          <h2>Aug 11th update: Saturday Social Returns!</h2>
          <p>
            Following the recently updated guidance from British Cycling, and a great response to our call out for ride
            leader volunteers, we are delighted that we can run our regular Saturday Social ride from Saturday 15th
            August.  We’ll be meeting from 8am at the library this week and going forward every Saturday, to set off on
            some usual, and maybe new routes, taking about 3 hours to ride around the lanes before returning to Peckham
            Rye.  Groups will be limited to 6 riders per group and will set off at 5 min spaces.  Those new to the club
            are welcome and encouraged to join on any Saturday ride: there’s no requirement to become a member, please
            just come along and introduce yourself.
          </p>
          <p>Once you've found your group at the library you'll need make sure you use <Link to='/track-trace'>the linked form to fill out your contact details for track and trace</Link>.</p>
