          <h2>Diversity and Inclusion</h2>

          <p>
            At Peckham CC we seek to be an inclusive and welcoming club as set out in our
            our <Link to='/ethos'>ethos and core ideals</Link>. Whilst we are exceptionally proud of our reputation as
            a friendly and approachable club, we also recognise that the lack of diversity in cycling is a major issue
            and that our club does not adequately reflect our local community. We want to address this and, working with
            our members, the club committee have been reflecting on what actions we need to take to improve our
            diversity and inclusion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our first step has been to look at our local context, the available guidance and research on diversity in
            cycling, key themes and barriers to inclusion and possible actions we can take. We have brought this
            research and thinking together in
            our <a href={diversityReport}>Peckham CC Diversity &amp; Inclusion Report</a>. This report is just our first
            step and the club is now working on a diversity and inclusion action plan which will be co-created with our
            members to ensure our actions reflect our local need and context.
          </p>
          <p>
            We think it's important to be transparent about this work so we will update this page with our latest
            actions.
          </p>

          <h3>South East London Diversity &amp; Inclusion Network</h3>

          <p>
            In August we convened a virtual meeting with representatives from other local cycling and triathlon clubs.
            The aim of this meeting was to discuss diversity in our clubs, the barriers to inclusion we each face and to
            share ideas and good practice for improving Diversity &amp; Inclusion.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a group we also discussed and redrafted a letter we are going to send to British Cycling asking them to
            take a more transparent and strategic approach to improving diversity in cycling and supporting clubs to
            improve our Diversity &amp; Inclusion.
          </p>
          <p>
            The group agreed that continued collaboration across our clubs would be positive for all of us and we are
            going to continue to work together to share ideas, help each other and develop initiatives to improve
            Diversity &amp; Inclusion.
          </p>
